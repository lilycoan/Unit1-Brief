# Implementation Plan

> EDITING DIRECTIVE: USER AND AGENT EDIT THIS FILE COLLABORATIVELY. THE USER MUST REVIEW AND APPROVE ITS CONTENT.

Purpose of this file: Turn the approved specification into ordered, updatable implementation and verification work.

## Instructions for the user

Preserve the approved requirements and verify the completed work. Direct priorities, scope, and meaningful checkpoints; judge technical choices, risks, and proposed changes; and approve results only after checking them against the specification rather than relying solely on the agent's report.

If the intended result changes, update the specification. If only the route changes, update this plan and record the revision.

## Instructions for the agent

Read AGENTS.md, brief.md, research.md, spec.md, and this file, then inspect the relevant project files. Begin with a concise orientation and one focused question.

Guide planning one stage at a time. Surface dependencies, risks, and verification needs without expanding scope or making decisions for the user. Draft concise, project-specific tasks and keep them current. Never mark approval gates or user-verification items complete on the user's behalf.

## Approach

Describe the technical approach, important dependencies, and the order in which the features will be built. Explain any non-obvious choices and identify likely risks.

## Checklist

Replace or expand the implementation placeholders below with tasks specific to the approved specification.

### Approval gates

- [ ] User has reviewed, verified, and approved the research claims and selected features
- [ ] User has reviewed and approved the specification
- [ ] User has reviewed and approved the implementation approach and task sequence

### Implementation

- [ ] Replace these placeholders with concrete tasks for each feature and supporting change
- [ ] Implement the tasks in meaningful checkpoints, keeping the plan and specification aligned with approved changes

### Verification

- [ ] User has checked feature behavior and calculations against the specification and sources independently of the agent
- [ ] User has confirmed factual and numerical claims have working citations and communicate important limitations or uncertainty
- [ ] User has confirmed the project runs locally, serves all three reference profiles, and matches the specification

### Delivery

- [ ] Commit meaningful checkpoints and export the working chat transcripts
- [ ] Add the provided Project 2 debrief, complete it after verification, and export its transcript

## Revisions

Record material changes to the approach, sequence, or checklist and explain why they were made.

## Commands

### Start planning

User: Open the project repository as your workspace, start a fresh chat, and type `start planning`.

### Start implementation

User: After approving the plan, open the project repository in a fresh chat and type `start implementation`.

Agent: Read AGENTS.md, brief.md, spec.md, and this file, then inspect only the project files relevant to the approved work. Follow AGENTS.md and the approved plan. Do not begin implementation if the plan has not been approved. Keep the plan current, but never mark approval gates or user-verification items complete on the user's behalf.

### Save transcript

Agent: At the end of planning, remind the user that the transcript is a deliverable and ask them to say `save transcript`. Wait for that direction. When directed, save the entire conversation in the `transcripts/` directory as `plan-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md`, mark user and agent responses clearly, and confirm the saved relative path.

Agent: At the end of every implementation chat, remind the user to say `save transcript`. When directed, save the entire conversation as `build-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md` using the same location and formatting.
