> EDITING DIRECTIVE: USER AND AGENT EDIT THIS FILE COLLABORATIVELY. THE USER MUST REVIEW AND APPROVE ITS CONTENT.

Purpose of this file: Develop and record the evidence and decisions that will guide the technical specification.

## Instructions for the user

You are responsible for the ethics, accuracy, and fairness of the research. Direct the inquiry toward useful questions, judge sources and suggestions rather than accepting them at face value, and approve only results supported by verified evidence and audience needs. Seek evidence that challenges your assumptions, represent uncertainty honestly, and reject claims you cannot verify. See [UNESCO's Guidance for generative AI in education and research](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/guidance-generative-ai-education-and-research).

## Instructions for the agent

Read AGENTS.md, brief.md, and this file. Begin with a concise orientation and one focused question.

Guide the research one stage at a time. Help the user explore options, assess sources, and identify contrary evidence or uncertainty without making decisions for them. Draft concise updates for review, and never mark research or feature choices approved on the user's behalf.

## Reference employee profiles

- Alex — Los Angeles, 24, junior video editor: Uses text, image, and video-generation tools for production work. Streams reference media and uses social platforms across a phone, laptop, and television. Wants to understand impacts beyond text prompts and is particularly attentive to water use.
- Jordan — Austin, 38, creative technologist: Uses coding agents and generative tools in long, irregular sessions. Games on a desktop PC and participates in frequent video calls. Finds "prompts per day" too simplistic and wants assumptions, ranges, and project-level totals.
- Robin — Chicago, 56, operations manager: Uses text AI occasionally but spends substantial time in video meetings, streaming media, and social platforms. Is skeptical of the company's motives and needs plain-language explanations, visible sources, and honest indications of uncertainty.

These are fictional starting profiles, not evidence about demographic groups. Research the activities, circumstances, and needs they represent rather than making assumptions based on age or location.

## Audience needs

Record information about the activities, circumstances, and needs represented by all three reference profiles. Separate evidence from assumptions that still need checking.

## Possible features

Generate several possibilities before choosing. Keep the initial notes brief. For each idea, record:

- what it would help someone learn or do
- the profiles or needs it would serve
- any evidence or implementation challenge that might affect it

## Source assessments

For each source, record:

- the full citation and working link
- the claim or figure the project may use
- evidence checked directly
- important limitations or uncertainty
- confidence and decision: use, use with qualifications, or reject

## Selected features

List the five selected features. Briefly explain why each was selected and how the set serves all three reference profiles. Name a few serious alternatives and explain why they were rejected.

User approval: Review the completed research directly. Confirm that sources exist and support the claims the project will use, correct the document as needed, and explicitly approve the selected features before developing the specification. The agent cannot complete this approval on the user's behalf.

## Commands

### Start research

User: Open the project repository as your workspace, start a fresh chat, and type `start research`.

### Save transcript

Agent: After the user approves the selected features, remind them that the transcript is a deliverable and ask them to say `save transcript`. Wait for that direction.

When the user directs the agent to save the transcript, the agent saves the entire conversation in the `transcripts/` directory as `research-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md`, marks user and agent responses clearly, and confirms the saved relative path.
